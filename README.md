I made a playlist with 200 unranked hard/challanging songs for ya'll

TL;DR: Download the file, go to your Beat Saber folder and shove it in the playlist folder.



Bruh I have no Idea what Im doin here, just gonna copy the same stuff I posted in the Beat Saber subreddit.

So for a while I wanted to make a playlist with intentionally unranked songs that were a bit on the harder side but hella fun to play. I now reached my semi goal of 200+ songs and wanted to share this playlist with this subreddit. 
Like I said all songs are unranked and it will stay that way, in case a song from this playlist gets ranked it will be removed.


If you're using Beat Saber version 1.5 (or older) playlists should work right away for you.

If you're using Beat Saber version 1.6.0 then you may need the PlaylistLoaderPlugin which you can find here: https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistLoaderPlugin/releases/tag/1.0.0
The Plugin version is 1.0.0, it will support both .json and .blist playlist formats. (So making ranked playlists with https://scoresaber.balibalo.xyz/peepee will also work again)

Mods for Beat Saber version 1.6.1/1.6.2 have just been released, I'm using 1.6.0 I'm not sure if playlists work for the newer 2 versions.


If you want to manage playlists/download songs manually I strongly recommend to use Alaanor's BeatList (Like beat drop but better imo)
Download link is here: https://github.com/Alaanor/beatlist


Please let me know if there are some ass songs, or songs that don't fit the playlist
ya can dm me here or over at discord. Shigataro#6182

I'm forced to add songs to the playlist until I reach 1000 songs total lmao
I will gladly take song recommendations :D
I'd say the avarage NPS is like ~8ish (there are a lot of songs with over 10 NPS in the playlist doe)

Lastly I want to thank my friends over our Discord server for sending me hella good maps.
